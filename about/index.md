## About us

**Land Gallery** is an active print studio (and former art gallery) in Portland, Oregon run by the folks from [buyolympia.com](https://buyolympia.com/). 

We provide in-house production for artists featured on buyolympia.com and other online and retail shops in a variety of mediums. Since 2008, we've been printing high-quality, gallery-ready pieces in-house.

The print studio is unfortunately **not open to the public**. 

## History

For over ten years we were an [art gallery and retail shop](https://archive.landpdx.com/) located on Mississippi Avenue in Portland, Oregon.
