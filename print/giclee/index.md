## giclée fancy inkjet

You'll hear the word giclée thrown around a lot as if it’s some mysterious process; all it really means is inkjet. Tiny droplets of ink are sprayed onto the paper, mixing together. The printers we use aren’t the kind of simple four-color inkjet you’d find at home.

We have a fleet of professional Epson art printers (we have over then of them) that utilize their UltraChrome archival inks in either 10 or 12 ink configurations that produce incredible results.

We print on high-quality wood and cotton-based papers that are resistant to fading and let us print a wider color gamut than traditional offset processes. The reds are redder and the pinks can be much more bright and vivid. It helps us capture the original art as close as possible.

We mostly print 8x10 and 11x14 prints (since that’s what most folks want to buy), but also can print larger 24" x 48" prints. 

We commonly stock the following sizes of paper: 8x10, 11x14, 13x19, 11x17 and 16x20.
