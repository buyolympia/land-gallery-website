## Digital Printing

When we say digital printing, we refer to our four-color, toner-based Konica-Minolta production printer.

This printer is a do-everything, small-run production printer. We’re able to print on heavier card stock as well as print and bind zines in a click.

We’re able to make up to 12x18 full-color, retail-worthy prints and posters using this device. Printing on this machine is less expensive than our giclée prints, but doesn’t offer the wider color gamut. Digital prints are toner-based, which means the toner is fused to the paper with heat, it looks slightly glossier and sits more *on top* of the paper than inkjet prints which are a wet-process that requires dry time.
