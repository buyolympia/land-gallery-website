## Risograph Artist Prints and More

The latest piece of equipment in the shop is our brand new Riso SF5450 EFII U. 

This Riso is a duplicator that's best described as if a classic silkscreen machine and a copier had a baby. 

Printing on the Riso is a wet process full of smudges, misalignments and stochastic screen patterns that create a uniquely distinct look. Each color is translucent and layered on each other one at a time — each a run through the machine, creating endless slight variation between prints.

Riso is not for the perfectionist, but we feel can create perfect prints. 

We current have [eleven different colors](inks/) that can be mixed and layered upon each other and are printing on a variety of papers.
