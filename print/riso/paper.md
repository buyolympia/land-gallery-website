## Papers we are printing on lately

Riso ink is made from the husks of rice, it's really cool — it takes something that might otherwise be thrown away or composted and turns it into highly functional, biodegradable ink — the only unfortunate part is that it takes _forever_ to really dry. And some inks, like Fluorescent pink stay a little wet (and possibly smudgy) for weeks.

We use porous, vellum-like papers as much as possible.
