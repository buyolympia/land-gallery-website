## The Art Gallery

Land Gallery was an art gallery and gift shop located in the historic Mississippi Neighborhood of Portland, Oregon. It opened in 2009 and closed in 2019.

It feature independent artists from the Northwest and beyond.

For over ten years, our upstairs gallery was home to about a dozen great art shows each year. The gallery closed at the onset of the pandemic and is now closed for good. The space that was used for the gallery has since been used to add equipment and expand our print studio.

Our gift shop historically featured an impressive collection of gifts, books, greeting cards, paper goods, crafts and more from over 100 artists — the same things found at the iconic indie shopping website buyolympia.com.

The retail shop was the basis and location for the famous [Put a Bird On It Portlandia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNpIOlDhigw) skit. 

The physical space served as a hub for artistic talent from the Pacific Northwest and beyond.

We’re sad to have closed the space, but proud of what we accomplished. And feel lucky to have got to host so many increadible shows.
